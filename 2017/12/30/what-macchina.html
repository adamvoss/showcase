    <p>Macchina is a <strong>key</strong> to unlock the control center of your car. Once you are in, Macchina can then be used to make changes and tweaks to your car. You can do anything from simple projects like stopping that annoying ding to more complex upgrades like unlocking more horsepower or improving fuel economy. Macchina arrives to you as a blank key - you have to cut it yourself. Learning how to cut that key (reverse engineering, writing code, and plain-old tinkering) is the fun and challenging part, but don’t worry you can do it, because a community of <strong>car nerds</strong> already exists. The community supports each other and you by sharing what we have learned and discovered together.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Definition:</strong> Translation from Italian [Noun] <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/macchina&quot;"><strong>macchina (ˈmakkina):</strong></a> 1. machine 2. car, automobile</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One of our other goals is to help grow and strengthen this community. We built Macchina using <strong>Open Source Hardware</strong> principles so that everyone involved can benefit from collaborative and iterative design improvements. To help make Macchina <strong>accessible</strong> to all, we are making a commitment to keep the price of our hardware as low as possible. We are making Macchina.cc more than just a store for hardware and tools, but also a hub for learning and disecting everything about cars.</p>
