<p>This is very exciting for us. We would like to thank everyone that has helped us make this possible. Aaron, Andy, Brian, Chris, Dan, Dave, Doug, Dustin, Helen, Jeff, Johnny, Kat, Ken, Mark, Melissa, Merlin, Rainer and Special Interest Auto Service; this would have been very difficult without you all. We would also like to thank the organizations that believed in our mission prior to launch even. Arduino, DIGI International, Digi-Key, Hackaday, Open Garages, and the EFF. Most importantly all of the car nerds out there that encouraged us to keep going and get this built.</p>
