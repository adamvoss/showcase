<p>Most of the developer units are shipped! With the exception of surveys that were just recently filled out and a couple spare units (more on that later), the large majority of developer units are in the hands of car hackers. This strategy is already paying off - they’ve already discovered a couple things that we will want to address before the larger production run begins. I know it feels far off to you, but we are already preparing for it and it feels like it’s coming fast for us.</p>

<p>As you can see below we have our forum up and it has been working pretty well for managing development! It is still a work in progress, but overall we are very happy with it. Stop in and check it out. Feel free to help out the development team in any way you can. Be aware that the main purpose right now is for just that - development!
